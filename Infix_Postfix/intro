Infix, prefix, and postfix are three ways to write expressions in data structures. 
They are used to write arithmetic and logical expressions


Infix     
The most common way to write expressions Operators are written between operands.
For example, \(A+B\) Easy to read for humans, Difficult for computers to parse because they need information about operator precedence, associativity rules, and brackets

Prefix     
Operators are written before operands 
For example, \(+AB\) Can be evaluated and parsed faster by machines than infix notation       

Postfix     
Operators are written after operands Also known as "Reverse Polish notation" 
For example, \(AB+\) Can be evaluated and parsed faster by machines than infix notation
