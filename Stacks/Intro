What is Stacks?

Stacks is a linear data structure which follows First In Last Out (FILO). FILO implies that the element that is inserted first, comes out last.
Stack in simple words does:
Pushing an element onto the stack is like adding a new plate on top on dishes.
Popping an element removes the top plate from the stack (plie of dishes).

Why Stacks?
Stack enables all data to operations at one end only. 
So the only element that can be removed is the element at the top of the stack, and only one item can be read or removed at a given time.
