<p>Linear data structure is a way of organizing data in a sequential order, with each element connected to the one before and after it</p>
<p>Examples are Arrays, Linked Lists, Queues and Stack</p>

<h1>Non Linear Data Structure</h1>
<p>A non-linear data structure is a way to store, organize, and manage data where elements are not in a sequence. Instead, elements are connected in specific ways to show relationships between them</p>
