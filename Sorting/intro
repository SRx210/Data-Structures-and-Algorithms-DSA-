Merge Sort and Quick Sort are two widely used divide-and-conquer algorithms for sorting.

Merge Sort
Algorithm
Divide: Recursively split the array into two halves until each subarray contains a single element (base case).
Conquer: Merge the subarrays back together in a sorted order.
Combine: Combine the sorted subarrays to produce the final sorted array.


Quick Sort
Algorithm
Choose a Pivot: Select a pivot element (can be the first, last, middle, or random element).
Partition: Rearrange the elements such that all elements less than the pivot are on the left, and all elements greater are on the right.
Recurse: Recursively apply the process to the left and right subarrays.
